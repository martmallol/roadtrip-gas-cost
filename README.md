# Roadtrip Gas Cost Calculator App
![Page Example](/roadtrip-gas-cost/src/img/sample-page.jpg)
This Web Page calculates how much money you'll have to spend on gas for your next roadtrip. It calculates it basing on the routes you'll take.

## Overview
### Users should be able to
- Insert all the trips that will take part of their roadtrip (US addresses and their proper state).
- Remove a trip if they want.
- Insert the gas type that they will be using for their car.
- Insert their car's fuel consumption (if they'd like to).

### Built with
- React JS.
- Bootstrap.
- Bing API & EIA (US Energy Information Administration) API.
- CSS.

### What I learnt
- Send requests to an API and use that information for the sake of my app.
- Utilize async-await functions and render the proper visuals on the web page. This depends on the following factors: 
    - If the fetching of the data was succesful. 
    - If it wasn't.
    - If it's still pending.
- Create the styling for mobile devices. The app's visuals are clean for desktop & smart devices.
